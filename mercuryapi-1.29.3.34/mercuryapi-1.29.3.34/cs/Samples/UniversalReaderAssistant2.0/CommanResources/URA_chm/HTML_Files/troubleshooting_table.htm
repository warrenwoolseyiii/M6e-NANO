    <td>Cannot connect to reader</td>
    <td>
<p>• Verify the hostname, IP address or COM port is correct. See the hardware specific guide for more details on setting up a connection.</p>
<p>• For the M6 and Astra-EX the reader control communicate uses the LLRP interface which uses <B>network port 5084</B>. Verify 5084 is not being blocked by the network firewall. </p>

  <tr>
    <td>Read “Performance” is slow</td>
    <td>
<p>Performance, as it relates to tag reading, is very usecase dependent. Typically, it comes down to whether you are trying to read lots of tags once or a few tags repeatedly. If the reader settings aren?t correct for your usecase the performance will appear poor.</p>
<p>	• Use the Performance Tuning Options to modify the settings for your usecase.</p>
<p>	• See the <I>MercuryAPI Programmer’s Guide | Performance Tuning</I> section for details about Gen2 settings and try using the Advanced Performance Tuning options directly.</p>

    <td>Errors after a Firmware Upgrade</td>
    <td>
<p>• If the upgrade was of the M6 from v4.7 to a newer version make sure to read the Release Notes of the newer version. There are special steps that must be taken to make that upgrade.</p>
<p>• Try reinstalling the firmware and restarting URA.</p>
