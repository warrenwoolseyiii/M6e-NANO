<h3> CAUTION ! </h3>
<p>If disconnecting from one reader and connecting to another (or connecting to the same, rebooted reader) it is recommended you restart URA. If URA isn't restarted the settings may become inconsistent between what is active on the reader and what is displayed in the URA <a href="#">Settings/Status section</a> section.</p>
