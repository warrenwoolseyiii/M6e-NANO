<p>As shown in Figure 5, the default displayed tag results show the following columns of data:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><B>#</B> - The order each tag was read.</li>
<li><B> EPC</B> - The EPC ID of the tag, typically 96-bits of data shown in Hex.</li>
<li><B> Timestamp</B> - The timestamp when the tag was last seen during this query.</li>
<li><B> RSSI</B> - The receive signal strength of the tag response, in dBm.</li>
<li><B> ReadCount</B> - The number of times the tag was read on [Antenna].</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above fields, additional fields can be displayed using the Display Options settings. These include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><B> Antenna </B>- the number of the antenna over which the tag was read.</li>
<li><B> Frequency </B>- the channel the reader was on when the tag was read, displayed in kHz (e.g. "915750").</li>
<li><B> Phase </B>- The phase, from 0 to 180 degrees, between the outgoing carrier and the signal reflected back by the tag.</li>
<li><B> Protocol </B>- Protocol used when the tag was read. (e.g. "Gen2", "ISO18000-6B", "IPX64", ATA etc). (Protocols are selected in the "Read/Write Options" panel. If only "Gen2" is displayed, then you have not applied the appropriate license to the module to read additional protocols.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If "Antenna" or "Frequency" are chosen, each combination of EPC, Antenna, and Frequency will be displayed on a separate line in the Tag Results Grid. </p>
<p>Clicking on a column header will reorder the displayed tags based on that field.</p>
